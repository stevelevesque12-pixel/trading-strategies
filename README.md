# Failed 2s (TheStrat) — intraday automation for Tradovate

Codifies the "Failed 2s" multi-timeframe reversal system (Failed-2 bias +
Market Structure Shift/FVG entry trigger) popularized in TheStrat community,
with a backtester and a Tradovate live-execution layer.

**This was built from research, not from watching the source video** — the
X/Twitter video this was requested from couldn't be accessed from this
environment (egress to x.com is blocked here). The rules below are a
best-effort reconstruction from public TheStrat/Trader-Mike material (see
research summary earlier in this conversation). Validate against your own
understanding of the setup before trusting it with money.

## Strategy logic

1. **Bias timeframe** — a Failed-2 (`F2U`/`F2D`) completes: a directional (2)
   candle that reverses and closes back against its own break (a failed
   liquidity sweep). This sets a directional bias and the swept level.
2. **Entry timeframe** — while that bias is active and we're inside the
   intraday entry window, wait for a Market Structure Shift (a strong-bodied
   close through the last confirmed opposite swing point) in the bias
   direction, confirmed by a Fair Value Gap. That's the entry trigger.
3. **Stop** — beyond the tighter of the broken swing point or the bias
   timeframe's swept level, plus a small tick buffer.
4. **Target** — `target_r * risk` (default 1:1).
5. **Intraday only** — all state (bias, swing structure) resets every session
   day. No new entries after `no_entry_after` (default 15:45 ET); any open
   position is force-flattened at `flatten_at` (default 15:55 ET).

Timeframe pairs implemented (entry timeframe, bias timeframe):

| Pair | Entry TF | Bias TF |
|---|---|---|
| `1m-15m` | 1 minute | 15 minute |
| `5m-1h` | 5 minute | 1 hour |
| `15m-4h` | 15 minute | 4 hour |

Code layout:
- `failed2s/` — pure strategy logic (bar classification, Failed-2, swing/MSS/FVG, the signal engine, risk manager, instrument specs). Shared by both backtest and live.
- `backtest/` — event-driven backtester over 1-minute OHLCV CSV data.
- `live/` — Tradovate REST/WebSocket client + live runner.
- `tests/` — unit tests for the strategy logic and a backtest smoke test.

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Backtesting

Data format: a CSV with `timestamp,open,high,low,close[,volume]` at
**1-minute** resolution (all three pairs are resampled from this single base
resolution). Get real 1-minute futures data from your data provider of
choice (Tradovate export, Databento, FirstRate Data, etc.) — no market data
API is wired into this repo.

A synthetic-data generator is included for smoke-testing the pipeline only
(NOT real market data — do not draw conclusions about edge from it):

```bash
python sample_data/generate_sample.py --days 20 --out sample_data/sample_1min.csv
```

**Single pair:**

```bash
python -m backtest.run --data sample_data/sample_1min.csv --pair 5m-1h --symbol MES
```

**Compare all three pairs on the same data** (this is what you want to
figure out which pair performs best):

```bash
python -m backtest.compare --data sample_data/sample_1min.csv --symbol MES
```

Prints a side-by-side metrics table (num trades, win rate, total P&L,
profit factor, avg R, max drawdown, expectancy) and writes:
- `trades_<pair>.csv` — a full trade log per pair
- `pair_comparison.csv` — the summary table

Both CLIs support `--symbol` (MES, ES, MNQ, NQ, MCL, CL, MGC, GC),
`--contracts`, `--daily-loss-limit`, `--max-daily-trades`, `--target-r`.

**Backtest assumptions/limitations** (so you know what you're looking at):
fills are simulated at the triggering bar's close and stop/target hits are
checked on subsequent entry-timeframe bars' high/low (one bar of latency, no
slippage/commission modeled); if a bar's range hits both stop and target the
stop is assumed to fill first (conservative). 4-hour resampling floors to
UTC-clock-hour boundaries via pandas, which may not perfectly match how your
data provider aligns 4H candles.

## Live trading on Tradovate

**Read this before pointing it at a funded account.** The Tradovate client
(`live/tradovate_client.py`) follows Tradovate's public API docs but has
**not been tested end-to-end against a real Tradovate account** from this
environment (no credentials, no network access to tradovateapi.com here).
Validate every call against a **demo** account first.

Environment variables:

```bash
export TRADOVATE_USERNAME=...
export TRADOVATE_PASSWORD=...
export TRADOVATE_APP_ID=...
export TRADOVATE_CID=...        # from Tradovate API settings
export TRADOVATE_SEC=...        # from Tradovate API settings
export TRADOVATE_APP_VERSION=1.0   # optional
export TRADOVATE_DEVICE_ID=failed2s-bot  # optional
```

Dry run (default — logs signals, sends no orders):

```bash
python -m live.runner --pair 5m-1h --symbol MES --account-spec <your_username>
```

Live (demo environment, explicit opt-in):

```bash
python -m live.runner --pair 5m-1h --symbol MES --account-spec <your_username> --live --env demo
```

Only after demo validation, live/real money:

```bash
python -m live.runner --pair 5m-1h --symbol MES --account-spec <your_username> --live --env live
```

Known gap: the runner logs each signal and places a bracket order but does
not yet wire Tradovate's order-fill/user-sync WebSocket back into the risk
manager, so the daily-loss-limit lockout won't see live fills until you add
that callback (`LiveRunner._on_finished_bar` has a note where to hook it
in). Don't rely on the daily loss limit unattended until that's wired up.

## Running the tests

```bash
pytest
```
